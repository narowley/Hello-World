# Overview

As a software engineer, there is a lot that I need to accomplish to better myself and become more proficent at programming. I don't want to limit my skill set by just one programming language, so I'm using the tools right now to find out as much as I can about as many programming languages as I can. I'm proficient at Python and R at the moment, but I recoginze there are more than just those two that I need to use. To learn more, I have decided to take a few weeks to learn the basics of a select few languauges, such as C++, Erlang, and Rust. By doing this, I belive I will grow the toolset necessary to become a better software engineer.

The software that I've created today is a very simple "Hello World" program. This peice of software isn't used to show the depth of my knowledge, but rather, to show a understanding of Python. All that this program does it print out "Hello World" to the user.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

The tool that I used to create this was Visual Studio Code. It's simple, but very deep, as it can be used to program with a variety of different languages without issues.

The language that I used to program with was Python. It's one of the most common languages used to code with. This isn't due to a lack of depth, but a easy to understand syntax and a wide variety of applications.
